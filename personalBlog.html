            <h1>Gender roles and relationship expectations in today's society</h1>
            <p>29th April</p>

            <p>
                Traditional  societal expectations of gender roles , whereby  men are expected to be solely providers while women are responsible for house chores
                 and taking care of the kids is portrayed as a crime . However, Patricia diligently challenges the traditional marriage ideals about a 
                    woman's place, in that Abel wants her to act like a subservient woman. She  questions the norm by being a strong, independent
                         woman who works tirelessly to support her family and raising her child,Trevor. She gets to a point where she leaves 
                         her job to support her husband's hustle, however it turns out she overpowered the husband's responsibility. 
                            Through all this Abel started developing   hate towards Patricia, in that she made him inferior, 
                                powerless and lost his position as 'head of family' .<br><br>

            Abel started feeling the need to control Patricia and claim back his position  after she started helping him in his business. He felt incompetent and 
                weak infront of her hence the urge to overpower her just to feel whole and complete as a man.
            
            Despite Patricia having a career and a place of her own, she was viewed as abel's wife, the title society expects from her. They expected her to shrink 
                 being termed as abel's wife, the thought “what will people say” pushed abel's expectations to cage patricia, as he viewed her as disrespectful.
                     Interestingly, modern men prefer having an independent woman in that they can share responsibilities but the woman is still expected
                         to do house chores. This is very ironic such that despite them sharing responsibilities, the men still want to feel superior
                                     and in control by belittling their women.
